Users add OXT or any of the supported cryptocurrencies to their Orchid account which is then used to pay providers for service while the VPN is connected.": "Un utente con larghezza di banda: per la prima volta, gli utenti possono pagare al volo una connessione Internet privata e sicura tramite nanopagamenti.
