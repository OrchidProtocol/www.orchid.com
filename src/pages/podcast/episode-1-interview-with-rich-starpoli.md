description:  In our premiere episode, we go down the rabbit hole with Rich Staropoli, whose career reads like a Tom Clancy spy novel. He's the former White House CIO for the Department of Homeland Security and a special agent for the Secret Service for 25 years. He discusses what it was like to protect President George W. Bush on September 11th, his thoughts on the current state of technology at DHS, what cybersecurity risks our country faces, and the future of our election systems.
