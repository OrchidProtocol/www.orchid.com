title: " Episode 3: Jyri Engestrom "
description:  We go down the rabbit hole with Jyri Engestrom, a partner at Yes VC, a venture capital firm that invests in startups set in motion by social movements. He shares his journey as a founder of both Jaiku and Ditto, which were acquired separately by Google and Groupon. We discuss the future of democracy, how technology affects humanity, and some recent efforts he and a few other entrepreneurs took to provide free testing for COVID-19.
