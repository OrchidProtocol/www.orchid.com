title: "Episode 121: UPA Panel"
description: "On today's show, we feature three members of the newly formed Universal Privacy Alliance who will participate in a panel discussion about the decentralized future. Founded by privacy leaders from Web3, the UPA brings together companies and individuals working on privacy-enhancing technologies to share resources, engage in public debates, and influence policymakers.

A fantastic line-up of notable guests joins host Derek E. Silva, including Tor Bair, Founder of the Secret Foundation,  Jaya Brekke, Chief Strategy Officer at Nym, and Travis Cannell, Head of Product at Orchid. This is a great conversation about the privacy revolution and building the next generation of the Internet."
