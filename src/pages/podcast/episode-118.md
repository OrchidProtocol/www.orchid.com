title: "Episode 118: Stephen Semmelroth"
description: "We are joined by Avant Communications' Cyber VP, Stephen Semmelroth, a world-class security expert. In the Army, Stephen served in Afghanistan and the Army's Cyber Corps, where he led a team of cyberspace experts to defend US assets across an entire continent. Stephen broke his back, leaving him paralyzed, and he had to relearn how to walk. In this fascinating discussion, we discuss military intelligence, code-breaking, how to think like a hacker, cyber security fear factors, and more."
