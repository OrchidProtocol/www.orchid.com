This is required for participation in the Orchid network as both a deterrent of client malfeasance as well as a determinant for ticket sizing in our nanopayment system.</1><2><0>Gas</0> Transactions made on the blockchain require small payments and a portion of the credits purchase goes to covering these costs for creating the Orchid account.</2><3><0>Fees</0> Transaction fees for accepting FIAT.</3></2><p>The purpose of Orchid credits is to open up use of the Orchid network to a wider range of users, such as users who aren’t familiar with cryptocurrency or don’t want to deal with the intricacies themselves.

  "@@HowHero__Subtitle2": "To do this, Orchid uses an ERC-20 staking token called OXT, a new VPN protocol for token-incentivized bandwidth proxying, and smart-contracts with algorithmic advertising and payment functions.

  "@@HowNodes__Content": "<p>Service providers on Orchid run software similar to a typical VPN daemon for protocols such as OpenVPN, but which speaks the Orchid protocol.</p><p>Orchid nodes maintain registration information in a stake registry and provider directory on Ethereum. The stake registry is optimized for enabling the Orchid app to automatically discover random servers in a decentralized environment, while the provider directory allows Orchid nodes to register metadata such as geolocation or additional services offered.</p>",
  "@@HowOxt__Content": "<p>OXT’s primary purpose is to provide a staking-advertising mechanism that aligns operator incentives to the benefit of the Orchid network and mitigates certain risks.</p><p>The OXT digital currency provides value in the Orchid network in a number of ways:</p><2><0>A Bandwidth Provider - Anyone can operate an Orchid Node, but must first stake OXT, with the more OXT that is staked, the greater the chances of reward in the Network.</0><1>A Bandwidth User - For the first time, users can pay-on-the-fly for a private, secure internet connection using nanopayments. Users add OXT or any of the supported cryptocurrencies to their Orchid account which is then used to pay providers for service while the VPN is connected.</1></2><p><0>Learn more about OXT.</0></p><p>The bandwidth marketplace is peer-to-peer and run in a completely decentralized manner without reliance on any central party. The primary reasons for this new digital currency OXT are:</p><5><0>To have a digital currency that is specifically tied to consumption of bandwidth on the Orchid network</0><1>To align operator incentives towards the benefit of the Orchid Network.</1></5><p>Accordingly, in addition to facilitating bandwidth transactions on the Network, the Orchid digital currency is used to prove a stake within the Orchid network that demonstrates a commitment by bandwidth providers, as well as to mitigate certain risks.</p>",
  "@@HowProtocol__Description": "The Orchid software is designed to use a custom VPN protocol, similar in scope to <1>OpenVPN</1> or <3>WireGuard</3>. The Orchid protocol is designed for high-performance networking and runs on top of WebRTC, a common web standard, widely used to transmit video and audio from inside browsers. Our protocol allows users to request access to remote network resources and pay for these resources using cryptocurrencies via the Orchid nanopayments system.",
  "@@HowStaking__Content": "<p>A provider stakes some number of OXT to create a stake deposit.</p><1><0>Anyone can stake OXT on nodes using the smart contract.</0><1>Clients select new nodes in proportion to their relative OXT deposit size.</1><2>Larger stake deposits thus lead to proportionally more users, bandwidth, and revenue.</2><3>If the node is already at max bandwidth capacity additional stake is effectively wasted.</3></1><p>Once tokens have been locked into a stake deposit they can be used immediately for bandwidth provisioning. If the provider wants to withdraw tokens from the staking contract, they have to start an “unlocking” process period, which involves a three month cooldown where their funds cannot be used as a stake deposit or transferred elsewhere by the provider.</p><p>Whatever the amount of value that is exchanged in the Orchid ecosystem, a given seller’s relative stake amount, as a percentage of the total stake, provides them that same percentage of user traffic and dealflow. Assuming typical and honest selling behavior (no users drop them for bad service) this dealflow will translate into a similar portion of the total revenue. The staking decisions of sellers is left to their own choices.</p>",
