Its creators invited us to bring our curiosity and explore that world freely.</p><p>As the Internet grew, exploring freely became harder.Web 2.0 business models incentivized companies to watch and track us and sell our data. And in some places, limits were placed on the information we can see.</p><p>But that is changing. The decentralized Web 3.0 being built on Ethereum is allowing the Internet to be reclaimed by its users.</p><p>At Orchid we share in this mission. We use Web 3.0 technology to offer users better digital privacy today, so we can realize the promise of the Web 1.0 and explore freely again.</p><p>Orchid was founded in 2017 to help restore the open and accessible Internet for everyone. Since then, we have grown an incredible team based in San Francisco and Berlin and launched the first incentivized, peer-to-peer privacy network in December, 2019.</p>",

Like all Orchid accounts, the account can be shared among devices.</0><p>What is being purchased when a user buys Orchid credits?</p><2><0><0>Balance</0> Based on the chosen pricing tier, the user will receive an Orchid account funded with an amount of xDai, subject to market fluctuations, which can be used to purchase bandwidth on the Orchid network.</0><1><0>Deposit</0> A portion of the purchase is invested as a deposit to the generated account. This is required for participation in the Orchid network as both a deterrent of client malfeasance as well as a determinant for ticket sizing in our nanopayment system.</1><2><0>Gas</0> Transactions made on the blockchain require small payments and a portion of the credits purchase goes to covering these costs for creating the Orchid account.</2><3><0>Fees</0> Transaction fees for accepting FIAT.</3></2><p>The purpose of Orchid credits is to open up use of the Orchid network to a wider range of users, such as users who aren’t familiar with cryptocurrency or don’t want to deal with the intricacies themselves. No personal information is accessed or stored by Orchid during the purchase process or in the use of the Orchid app.</p><4><0>Crypto-native accounts:</0><br/> Users looking to supply their own OXT or other supported cryptocurrencies to fund their participation in the Orchid network can create a custom account using Orchid’s web3 based dapp at <3>account.orchid.com</3>. The Orchid Account dapp can only be accessed using a web3 browser such as <5>Metamask</5>, and allows linking of crypto wallets in order to build custom accounts with granular controls. Here, users can fund an account with their own specified values as well as control the size of the associated deposit, influencing <7>efficiency</7> experienced within the Orchid app. These accounts can be easily linked to the Orchid app as an alternative to purchased accounts as well as shared with an unlimited number of people and/or devices.</4><5><0>Learn more about creating an Orchid account.</0></5>",

  "@@HowNano__Content": "<p>Orchid uses a new probabilistic nanopayment system to scale payment throughput.</p><p>This nanopayment system is the foundation of the Orchid peer to peer bandwidth marketplace where clients pay Node operators cryptocurrency-backed “tickets” for proxy bandwidth.

  "@@HowOxt__Content": "<p>OXT’s primary purpose is to provide a staking-advertising mechanism that aligns operator incentives to the benefit of the Orchid network and mitigates certain risks.</p><p>The OXT digital currency provides value in the Orchid network in a number of ways:</p><2><0>A Bandwidth Provider - Anyone can operate an Orchid Node, but must first stake OXT, with the more OXT that is staked, the greater the chances of reward in the Network.</0><1>A Bandwidth User - For the first time, users can pay-on-the-fly for a private, secure internet connection using nanopayments. Users add OXT or any of the supported cryptocurrencies to their Orchid account which is then used to pay providers for service while the VPN is connected.</1></2><p><0>Learn more about OXT.</0></p><p>The bandwidth marketplace is peer-to-peer and run in a completely decentralized manner without reliance on any central party. The primary reasons for this new digital currency OXT are:</p><5><0>To have a digital currency that is specifically tied to consumption of bandwidth on the Orchid network</0><1>To align operator incentives towards the benefit of the Orchid Network.</1></5><p>Accordingly, in addition to facilitating bandwidth transactions on the Network, the Orchid digital currency is used to prove a stake within the Orchid network that demonstrates a commitment by bandwidth providers, as well as to mitigate certain risks.</p>",
