# The Orchid Website

## Development server

Install all of the dependencies using `yarn`.

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to
`http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new
component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

To build a static version of the site, which will display most of everything even if javascript is turned off, use `yarn run build:static`.  This produces an error, but nobody cares about that, except for me, because I'm a shitty fucking perfectionist.  However, I won't put the time in to fix it, because it isn't my job to make websites.  (bfox is "me" in that rant.)

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
