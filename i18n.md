# Translations / Localization / i18n

The following libraries are used in the translation process:

- [i18next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next)
- [gatsby-plugin-react-i18next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-react-i18next)
- [react-i18next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-i18next)
- [babel-plugin-i18next-extract](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-i18next-extract)

A script runs and watches for changes in the `yarn start` / `gatsby develop` command which automatically dumps any strings it picks up into [extractedTranslations/en/common.json](extractedTranslations/en/common.json), it won't however pick up strings that are not passed into [translation components](#Translating-strings). When you notice `common.json` has changed, that's a good indicator to run through the translation process.

The helper script for updating translation files can be ran using `yarn extract`, which runs [`import-i18n.js`](import-i18n.js)
This script does a few essential tasks

- Deletes the current [common.json](extractedTranslations/en/common.json) file to remove old strings no longer present on the site.
  - These are backed up in crowdin if needed later
- Runs the string extraction process to extract all new strings on the site into [extractedTranslations/en/common.json](extractedTranslations/en/common.json)
- Imports new and existing translated strings from `translationImport/common_{locale}.json`
  - Checks all strings, identifies if any are missing for each locale
  - Does a "close enough match" for translations that are approximately "70%" similar or so in case a minor change was made on the English site since the last translation
  - Dumps all completed strings into their appropriate `src/locales/...` folder
  - Dumps missing and "close enough" strings into `pendingTranslations/{locale}/needsupdate.json`

## Translating strings

There are two components you can use to translate strings, the [`t()`](https://react.i18next.com/latest/usetranslation-hook) function, and the [`<Trans>`](https://react.i18next.com/latest/trans-component) component.

Any strings you pass to these will be collected by the import script during the extraction/development process, and when deploying the site will be translated if a matching translation is found.
